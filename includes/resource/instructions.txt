How to import the REV into Bibleworks.

This assumes you have extracted the bwexport.zip file somewhere on your computer..

It is also assumed you have Bibleworks 7 or greater. This -may- work with earlier versions, but it has not been tested.

1) Copy or move the rev.ddf file into the folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\BibleWorks XX\userdb". Replace the XX with the version number of the BW program you own.
2) Copy or move the rev.txt file into the folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\BibleWorks XX\databases". Replace the XX with the version number of the BW program you own.
3) Start Bibleworks.
4) Click "Tools/Importing/Exporting Information/Version Database Compiler".
5) In the window that opens, under #1 "Database Description File (DDF)", click "Open", and load the rev.ddf file.
6) Under #2 "Database Raw Text File", click "Browse" and navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\BibleWorks XX\databases, and double-click "REV.txt".
7) In the lower right, make sure "Install after Compiling" is checked.
8) Click the "Compile" button. The database should compile, and you should see "...Build was successful. Installed in: c:\program files (x86)\bibleworks XX\databases" in the output window.
9) Click the "Close" button, and the REV should now be useable from within Bibleworks.

The Greek and Hebrew words are parsed out of the commentary. Diacritic letters are converted to standard English letters.

Please let me know of any issues

I will work on solving them.
