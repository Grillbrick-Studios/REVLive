<h2>Instructions for installing the REV into &ldquo;Accordance&rdquo;</h2>
  <p>Installing the REV Bible</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You must have Accordance installed on your Computer. <span style="color:red;">If you have a PC, you must be running version 13.1.7 or higher.</span>  The program is available for purchase at $59.95 at the <a href="https://www.accordancebible.com/product/basic-starter-collection-accordance-13/">Accordance</a> website.</li>
    <li>Make sure that Accordance is running.</li>
    <li>Download the REV_Accordance.zip file and extract it to a place on your computer that you can locate.</li>
    <li>In the Accordance program, click "File/User files/Import Bible Text..."</li>
    <li>In the window that pops up, locate the REV.txt file that you just extracted, and click "Open."</li>
    <li>Accept the name "REV" by clicking "OK".</li>
    <li>Accordance will process the file. Then Enter "Revised English Version" as the full name of the Bible.</li>
    <li>The REV Bible will now be available within Accordance.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Installing the REV Commentary</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make sure that Accordance is running.</li>
    <li>If you have previously imported the REV Commentary, you must delete it from Accordance. Locate it in the "MY STUFF/My Notes" section of the left menu panel, right-click on it and click "Remove."</li>
    <li>Download the REV_Accordance.zip file and extract it to a place on your computer that you can locate.</li>
    <li>In the Accordance program, click "File/User files/Import Notes Folder..."</li>

    <li>In the next window that pops up, locate the Notes folder that you just extracted, and click "Open."</li>
