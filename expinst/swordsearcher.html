<h2>Instructions for installing the REV into &ldquo;Swordsearcher&rdquo; on a Windows PC</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>You must have Swordsearcher installed on your PC.  A trial version is available for free at <a href="https://www.swordsearcher.com/download.html">https://www.swordsearcher.com/download.html</a>. Or you may purchase the full version at that same link for $59.95.</li>
    <li>Make sure that the Swordsearcher program is <span style="color:red;">not</span> running.</li>
    <li>Download the Swordsearcher file from the <a href="/expt">Export</a> section of the REV website,
        keeping track of where your browser is saving the file to.  Usually, this will be in your &ldquo;Downloads&rdquo; folder, as seen here in Windows Explorer.
