<h2>Instructions for installing the REV into &ldquo;MySword&rdquo; on an Android tablet or phone</h2>
  Before you begin, please read <a href="#step9">step #9</a> first.
  <ol>
    <li>You must have MySword installed on your Android phone or tablet.  The app is available for free in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riversoft.android.mysword&hl=en">Google Play Store</a>.</li>
    <li><strong><span style="color:red">NOTE:</span></strong> If you are updating the REV in MySword, make sure your phone's download folder does not contain any MySword files (files ending in ".mybible").
        If the downloads folder already contains a copy of the file you are downloading, Android will rename the newly downloaded file and it will not be imported into MySword.
        See step #8 below for more information.</li>
    <li>Make sure that the MySword app is <span style="color:red;">not</span> running. You can do this by tapping the "Recently Used" button on your phone and swipe all running apps off the screen.</li>
    <li>In Chrome, go to the <a href="/expt">Export</a> section of the REV website and choose the module you want to download.  Make sure "MySword" is selected, choose the module you want, then click "Proceed".<br />
        <img src="/expinst/images/MySword_inst1.jpg" alt="" style="border:1px solid black" /></li>
    <li>Tap the "Click here" link to download the file, and once the download is complete, you will see this screen. Tap on the "Open" link.<br />
        <img src="/expinst/images/MySword_inst2.jpg" alt="" style="border:1px solid black" /></li>
    <li>You will see one of these two screens. If this is the first time you are installing the REV, you will see the first one. If you updating the REV,
        you will see second one.<br />

        <img src="/expinst/images/MySword_inst4.jpg" alt="" style="border:1px solid black" /></li>
    <li>Tap "yes", and MySword will open and load the REV module into the app.<br />
        <img src="/expinst/images/MySword_inst5.jpg" alt="" style="border:1px solid black" /></li>
    <li><span style="color:red">It is important</span> that when you are finished installing the REV MySword files into the app that you delete the files from your phone's download folder.
        Every phone has some sort of file manager app, or there are free third-party apps available.  You need to open the file manager and navigate to your downloads
        folder, which is usually "/sdcard/Download". Then delete any files with the extension ".mybible". If you do not do this, when you go to do REV updates in the future,
        they will not work.</li>
    <li><a name="step9" id="step9"></a>Hopefully this will not apply to you, but we have experienced some situations where Android does not know what to do with the downloaded MySword files.
        If this is the situation on your device, when you tap "Open" in step #5 above, you will get a message that Android cannot open the file.  If this happens,
        all is not lost. You will need to use a file manager to manually move the file(s) from the download folder to the appropriate MySword folder.
        Make sure MySword is not running, then:<br />&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li>If you downloaded the REV Bible, the Rev_Bible.bbl.mybible file needs to be moved from /sdcard/Downloads to /sdcard/mysword/bibles.</li>
          <li>If you downloaded the REV Commentary, the Rev_Commentary.cmt.mybible file needs to be moved from /sdcard/Downloads to /sdcard/mysword/commentaries.</li>
          <li>If you downloaded the REV Appendices, the Rev_Appx.bok.mybible file needs to be moved from /sdcard/Downloads to /sdcard/mysword/books.</li>
        </ul>
        We wish there was an easier way. But once you do it a time or two, it becomes easy.
        </li>
